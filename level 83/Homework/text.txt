Modules are files that export code (functions, objects, or variables) and allow other files to import and use it.

How to export:
Named Export: You can export multiple things from a module.
Default Export: You can export one thing (a function, class, or object) as the default export.

How to import:
Named Import: You import specific exports from a module.
Default Import: You import the default export.

Benefits of using modules:
Code organization: Helps break up large code into smaller, manageable files.
Reusability: You can reuse code across different parts of your app.
Scalability: As your project grows, managing dependencies becomes easier.

How to use in a browser:
Use the type="module" attribute in a script tag:
<script type="module" src="app.js"></script>

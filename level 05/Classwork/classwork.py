# task 1
# we have declared variable name to 5 
a = 5
#we have reassigned a value for variable  to 6
a = 6
#we have reassigned a value for variable  to 10
a = 10
print(a)
#reassign works this way: if we declare one variable name multiple times, it will display the last one

#task 2

#comments- to explain and give describtion to our code, to make it easier to read and understand

#snake_case- makes it easier to read variable name that contains multiple words, programmers discussed and decided to use snake case in python
my_name_is = "Mariami"

#case_sensitive- lowercase and uppercase is different for python so we need to pay attention to them, to not get an error
b = 20

            <p>Egypt, officially the Arab Republic of Egypt, is a transcontinental country spanning the northeast corner of Africa and<br> the Sinai Peninsula in the southwest corner of Asia.
                Egypt has one of the longest histories of any country, tracing its heritage along<br> the Nile Delta back to the 6th-4th millennia BCE. Considered a cradle of civilisation, 
                Ancient Egypt saw some of the earliest<br> developments of writing, agriculture, urbanisation, organised religion and central government. Egypt was an early and important centre<br>
                of Christianity, later adopting Islam from the seventh century onwards. Cairo became the capital of the Fatimid Caliphate in the tenth<br> century, and of the Mamluk Sultanate in the 13th century.
                Egypt then became part of the Ottoman Empire in 1517, before its local<br> ruler Muhammad Ali established modern Egypt as an autonomous Khedivate in 1867. 
            </p>

            <p>The country was then occupied by the British Empire and gained independence in 1922 as a monarchy.<br> Following the 1952 revolution, Egypt declared itself a republic. 
                For a brief period between 1958 and 1961 Egypt merged with<br> Syria to form the United Arab Republic. Egypt fought several armed conflicts with Israel in 1948, 1956, 1967 and 1973, 
                and occupied<br> the Gaza Strip intermittently until 1967. In 1978, Egypt signed the Camp David Accords, which recognised Israel in exchange<br> for its withdrawal from the occupied Sinai. 
                After the Arab Spring, which led to the 2011 Egyptian revolution and overthrow<br> of Hosni Mubarak, the country faced a protracted period of political unrest; this included the election in 2012 of a brief,<br>
                short-lived Muslim Brotherhood-aligned Islamist government spearheaded by Mohamed Morsi, and its subsequent<br> overthrow after mass protests in 2013.

            <h2 id="history"><u>Ancient Egypt</u></h2>
            <p>Ancient Egypt was a civilization of ancient Northeast Africa. It was concentrated along the lower reaches of the Nile River,<br> situated within the contemporary territory of modern-day Egypt. 
                Ancient Egyptian civilization followed prehistoric Egypt<br> and coalesced around 3100 BC (according to conventional Egyptian chronology) with the political unification of Upper<br> and Lower Egypt 
                under Menes (often identified with Narmer).<br> The history of ancient Egypt unfolded as a series of stable kingdoms interspersed by periods of relative<br> instability known as "Intermediate Periods". 
                The various kingdoms fall into one of three categories:<br> the Old Kingdom of the Early Bronze Age, the Middle Kingdom of the Middle Bronze Age, <br>or the New Kingdom of the Late Bronze Age.

            <p>The Egyptians were one of the first major civilisations to codify design elements in art and architecture. Egyptian blue, also known as<br> calcium copper silicate, is a pigment used by Egyptians for thousands of years. 
                It is considered to be the first synthetic pigment.<br> The wall paintings done in the service of the Pharaohs followed a rigid code of visual rules and meanings.<br> Egyptian civilisation is renowned for its colossal pyramids,
                temples and monumental tombs. <br><br>
                Well-known examples are the Pyramid of Djoser designed by ancient architect and engineer Imhotep, the Sphinx, and the temple of<br> Abu Simbel.
                Modern and contemporary Egyptian art can be as diverse as any works in the world art scene, from the vernacular<br> architecture of Hassan Fathy and Ramses Wissa Wassef, 
                to Mahmoud Mokhtar's sculptures, to the distinctive Coptic iconography of<br> Isaac Fanous. The Cairo Opera House serves as the main performing arts venue in the Egyptian capital.

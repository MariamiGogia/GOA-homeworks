            <h2>Her childhood</h2>
            <p><i>Beyonce Giselle Knowles</i> was born on <b>September 4, 1981,</b> at the Park Plaza Hospital in Houston, 
                Texas to Celestine "Tina" Knowles (née Beyonce), a hairdresser and salon owner, and Mathew Knowles, 
                a Xerox sales manager.<br> Tina is Louisiana Creole and Mathew is African American.
                Beyoncé's younger sister, <i>Solange Knowles,</i> is also a singer and a former backup dancer for <u>Destiny's Child. </u>
                Solange and Beyoncé are the first sisters to have both had number one solo albums.</p>

            <p>Beyoncé was raised Methodist and attended St. John's United Methodist Church in Houston.
                As her mother's family was Catholic, her family attended Midnight mass at St. Mary of the Purification 
                Catholic Church on Christmas Eve. She went to <u>St. Mary's Catholic Montessori School</u> in Houston and enrolled
                 in dance classes there. Her singing ability was discovered when <i>dance instructor Darlette Johnson</i> began 
                 humming a song and Beyonce finished it, able to hit the high-pitched notes. Beyoncé's interest in music and 
                 performing continued after winning a school talent show at age seven, singing John Lennon's "Imagine" to
                  beat 15/16-year-olds. In the fall of 1990, Beyoncé enrolled in Parker Elementary School, a music magnet 
                  school in Houston, where she performed with the school's choir. She also attended the High School for the 
                  Performing and Visual Arts and later <u>Alief Elsik High School.</u> Beyoncé was also a member of the choir 
                  at St. John's United Methodist Church where she sang her first solo and was a soloist for two years.</p><br><br><br><br>

            <h2>Career</h2>
            <p>When Beyoncé was eight, she met <i>LaTavia Roberson</i> at an audition for an all-girl entertainment group. 
                They were placed into a group called Girl's Tyme with three other girls, and rapped and danced on the talent 
                show circuit in Houston. After seeing the group, R&B producer Arne Frager brought them to his Northern California 
                studio and placed them in Star Search, the largest talent show on national TV at the time. Girl's Tyme failed to win, 
                and Beyoncé later said the song they performed was not good. In <b>1995</b>, Beyoncé's father, Matthew, resigned 
                from his job to manage the group. The move reduced the family's income by half, and Beyoncé's parents were 
                forced to sell their house and cars and move into separated apartments.</p>

            <p>Mathew cut the original line-up to four and the group continued performing as an opening act for other established 
                <b>R&B girl groups</b>. The girls auditioned before record labels and were finally signed to Elektra Records, moving to 
                Atlanta Records briefly to work on their first recording, only to be cut by the company. This put further strain 
                on the family, and Beyoncé's parents separated. <b>On October 5, 1995</b>, Dwayne Wiggins's Grass Roots Entertainment
                 signed the group. In <b>1996</b>, the girls began recording their debut album under an agreement with Sony Music, 
                 the Knowles family reunited, and shortly after, the group got a contract with Columbia Records with the assistance 
                 of Columbia talent scout Teresa LaBarbera Whites.</p><br><br><br><br>

                As of April 2014, the couple had sold a combined 300 million records together.They are known for their private 
                relationship, although they have appeared to become more relaxed since 2013.Both have acknowledged difficulty 
                that arose in their marriage after Jay-Z had an affair.</p>

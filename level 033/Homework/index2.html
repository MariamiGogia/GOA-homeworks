                    Favourite phrase:<br><i>"We don't read and write poetry because it's cute, we read and write poetry because we are members of the human race.<br> And the human race is filled with passion. Medicine, law, business, engineering, these are noble pursuits and necessary to sustain<br> life. 
                    But poetry, beauty, romance, love, these are what we stay alive for."</i> - Mr. Keating (Dead poets society)

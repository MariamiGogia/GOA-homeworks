Answer the kahoot questions:
1. str data type is immutable
2. we know that str is immutable, but it has method called .replace(), this method doesn't change the value, it creates new variable
with its new value
3. list - []; dic - {}; tuple - (); set - {}
4. "I created function", is not correct, because in programming we say that "we declared/defined function"
5. python is case-sensitive language, because "a" and "A" are not the same symbols for python
6. print (True + True) will output 2, because True = 1 when we do mathematical excersises
7. print(1_000_000) will output 1000000, because underscore is ignored for computers, it's for us, so we could easily read code
8. empty list is Falsey value, everything that is empty, their values will be False
9. we can create list comprehesion with if statement, for example: [i for i in range(27) if i % 3 == 0]
10. we can create list comprehesion with if-else statement, for example: [i if i%2 == 0 else "_" for i in range(27)]
11. yes, we can define function inside function, for example def greet():
                                                                   def person():
                                                                     return "Hello, person!"
                                                                return person()
12. yes there is error type called "ZeroDivisionError", it will appear when we want a number to be divided by 0
13. lambda functions are anonymous functions
14. print(not"") will output True, because empty string has Falsey value and not Falsey means Truthy
15. in python "Everything is an Object"
16. is and == operators are not the same, they do differnet things that's why we have both of them
"The == operator is used to compare the equality of objects
 The is operator is used to check if different variables are pointing to the same object in memory"
17. python is high-level programming language, because it's new, easy and far from hardware

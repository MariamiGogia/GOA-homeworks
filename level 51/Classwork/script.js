// task 1
// we use js to control and create movements on the website, have interactives, for example to show on the screen alert messeage
// or make changes/movements when we click an image, make animations

//task 2
//event is specific actions that happens after we do something. for example after we click on button or moving the mouse

//task 3
//js is dynamic languge so with it we use dynamic variables, with variables we can make calculations and operations

//task 4
//when we want to create a variable we use: let, var, const


//task 5
//it will show an error because you can't declare the same variable (num) twice using let.
// it should be like this: let num = 50;  num = 60   without let

//task 6
// when we need sentance to look readable in js, we start the new word's letter with uppercase, so this uppercased letters
// looks like a humps of camel, that is why we call it CamelCase

    <!--There is position property in CSS, this property gives us more control on elements and we can
    place HTML elements however we want. Its values are: static, absolute, relative, fixed, sticky.
    when element has position:static; value there is no change on design, because it's default value.
    when element has position:absolute; value this element aligns on the next layer and now with properties
    we can move it wherever we want.
    when element has position:relative; value this elment stays on the same layer but with properties we can move
    it wherever we want. element takes static position as a reference.
    when element has position:fixed; value this element stays in the same place where we left it and it'll not move
    even if we scroll the page.
    when element has position:sticky; value this element will stick to the screen after there is no space left for it
    and even if we scroll it will be sticked with screen.-->

    <!--task 3-->
    <!--position:static; doesn't do something special, so everything will be same
    with position:absolute; we can align items wherever we want and also above the other elements,
    with position: relative; we can align items wherever we want and element takes as a reference static position,
    so we don't need to size the coordinates from left-corner.
    with position:fixed and position:sticky; we can do header part(navbar or menu part), because they both
    stay in the same place, difference is that position:sticky; won't affect until we define offset.-->

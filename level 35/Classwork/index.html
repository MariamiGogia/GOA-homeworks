   <!--static is default value, because of this it doesn't
   change anything-->
   <!--absoule aligns item in the next layer and you can 
   change coordinates-->
   <!--relative it makes connection between parent and child
   elements and you can change coordinates, but this is
   in the same layer-->
   <!--fixed is when item doesn't change its place and
   no matter it will be there always -->
   <!--sticky is when you scroll item will stick to the screen-->

   <!--task 3-->
   <!--absolute (0;0) coordinate is the screen's left corner and when you write your coordinates it will start calculating from
   that corner, also item with position: absolute; will align in the next layer.
   relative (0;0) coordinate is place where item is placed and item with position: relative; will take place on the same layer as others-->

    <!--The content box is where appears p, img, button and ect. -->
    <!--padding is place between the context box and border-->

    <!--Inline elements are elements that use only space that they need, for example: img and buttons-->
    <!--Block-level elements are elements that use whole row, even they don't need, for example: p and div-->

    <!--task 5-->
    <!--text-align:center property works only with block-level elements,
    button is inline element and it uses only space that needs, so technically
    it is center of the content box, that is why we cannot see any change when we
    use text-align:center with button or elements that are inline elements. -->

    <p><b>The learning process</b><br><br>
        In Goa, classes are held online in the well-known application, Discord. 
        <br>The duration of the lesson is 2 hours and the break is 10 minutes. Each group has a mentor who conducts<br> the lesson 
        and absolutely all children are involved in the lesson. To explain, we use the application 
        SoloLearn ( <a href="https://www.sololearn.com/en/learn/courses/coding-foundations">sololearn</a> ).
    </p>

        <p><b>Hackathon</b><br><br>
            In addition to teaching, hackathons are held in Goa, where we invite several groups. 
            <br>We divide the children into groups and the competition begins. The group that wins will definitely be rewarded. 
            <br>There is a dress code at the hackathon and it is necessary for the child to dress classically. 
            <br><br><u color="green">Junk food is not allowed at the hackathon.</u>
        </p>

        <p><b>Goaland </b><br><br>
             In addition to the hackathon, Goaland is also held, where the students of Goa gather and have fun. <br>
             There are fun activities as well as barbecuing, taking photos and meeting new people.
